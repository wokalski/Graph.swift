Whether we realise it or not, [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) problems sometimes occur in our day to day job. Implementing detailed algorithms from scratch every time I need them is not what I want.

This micro framework aims to implement graph algorithms in a way that they are no pain to use. I wrote about the motivation behind the protocol based approach [here](http://wokalski.com/Separating-behaviors-and-state-in-Swift/).
